## Dataset Description
This dataset contains value factors for quantifying environmental impacts in monetary terms. It includes JSON files for structured data, PDFs for detailed reports, and CSVs for tabular data.

 This repository contains a derivative data set of the International Foundation for Valuing Impacts Global Value Factor Database, which was released during UN Climate Week in 2024. 
 
 This derivative data set was originally compiled by me, Daniel Rosehill, released onto Github as a repository and is now copied and made available also on Hugging Face. 

 The derivative data set is merely a reformatting of the original data, which was released in XSLM format. 
 
 The reformatted and reshaped data set provides the same data, but in JSON and CSV format to support data analysis and visualization workloads. 
 
 Some other minor formatting changes were made, such as removing the US dollar symbol from numeric fields where they appeared (instead the currency is noted in metadata files), but no substantive changes were made to either the data or its constitution.
 
 The dataset consists of a range of value factors which are almost all segmented on a geographical basis. 
 
 The purpose of these value factors is to enable companies to convert their environmental impacts into monetary terms in support of a practice known as impact accounting.
 
In the envisioned use, these value factors would be paired with companies' data about their greenhouse gas emissions (GHG), land use, wastewater consumption and pollution and other impacts. 

Those would be integrated into the preparation of financial accounts. This data set is shared to this platform with the kind permission of the IFVI whose only stipulation is that users should adhere to the license which is provided at the root of this repository. Although this summary is not a substitute for reading the license, the licensing generally permits non commercial use of the data. Usage requests can additionally be made directly to IFVI.

Beyond the use case for account preparers there are other potentially interesting use cases in these value factors, which have been formulated on the basis of the best scientific opinion. 

They could be used in modeling government policy decisions to incentivise or disincentivise environmental activities by non profit seeking to. understand or estimate the extent of companies' non financial impacts among other uses. 

This dataset may or may not be the latest version of the GVFD and the original database should in all cases be considered the authoritative source that can be downloaded via the IFVI's website at ifvi.org.
